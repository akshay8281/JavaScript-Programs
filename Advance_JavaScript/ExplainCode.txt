Certainly! This code is using nested loops to generate a pattern that represents a rectangular box with asterisks (*) forming the border and spaces inside. Here's a step-by-step explanation:

let num = 5;
let row = " ";

for (let i = 1; i <= num; i++) {
    for (let j = 1; j <= num; j++) {
        if (i === 1 || i === num) {
            // If it's the first or last row, add an asterisk
            row += "*";
        } else if (j === 1 || j === num) {
            // If it's the first or last column, add an asterisk
            row += "*";
        } else {
            // Otherwise, add a space
            row += " ";
        }
    }
    // Move to the next line after each row
    row += "\n";
}

console.log(row);


Here's the breakdown:

Outer Loop (i loop):

Initializes i to 1.
Continues as long as i is less than or equal to num (which is 5 in this case).
Increments i by 1 after each iteration.


Inner Loop (j loop):

Initializes j to 1.
Continues as long as j is less than or equal to num.
Increments j by 1 after each iteration.


Conditions:

If i is the first or last row (i === 1 || i === num), it adds an asterisk to the row string.
If j is the first or last column (j === 1 || j === num), it adds an asterisk to the row string.
If none of the above conditions are met, it adds a space to the row string.


New Line:

After completing the inner loop for a particular value of i (i.e., after constructing a row), a newline character (row += "\n";) is added to move to the next line.


Output:

Finally, the entire row string is logged to the console.
The output will be a solid rectangular box made of asterisks with an empty space inside:
